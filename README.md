# exercise-coin


This is exercise coin. It will be a multipart application. There will be an android/ios version. this app will track your exercise stats, the amount of steps you take in a day. that sort of thing. This information will be piped back to our middleware server. this server will look for bouts of sustained exercise ig, the person steps for more than 60 seconds in a row ( but also doing some analysis to make sure they didnt just put a pedometer in a paint mixer ) once this metric is reached, you will engage a fork of https://github.com/sp00nznet/F7CoinV4, here after called exercise-coin. that means you'll need to follow along the commits and generate a new geneisis hash for this new coin and all the associated accoutremount with making this and not having it impact other altcoins. The flow will look like this Walking -> App Trigger -> Server Trigger ( after count ) -> coin daemon engaged ( mine for a small window equivilent to how much exercise was done ) -> payout? if available coins are produced. This will happen on a per user basis so each user that uses exercise-coin will need to have their own daemon spun up to support them. the server back end will need persistant storage as well as user logging to track this. it will need to track user <-> wallet transactions. this app is inteded as a fitness motivational too, get paid to exercise kinda thing.
